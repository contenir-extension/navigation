/**
 * Build the add-on's dashboard scripts into public/js, which is committed:
 * one ES module per component in assets/js/components, each
 * default-exporting its component class for the host's registry to mount,
 * with the code they share (BaseComponent, SortableJS) split into
 * public/js/chunks/. The stylesheet in public/css is written by hand.
 *
 * The output must depend on the sources alone, so CI can rebuild and diff
 * it: public/js is emptied first so a chunk whose hash changed leaves no
 * stale file behind, paths are taken relative to the package root, and no
 * source map is written.
